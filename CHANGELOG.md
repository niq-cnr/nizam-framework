### Added

- Framework genesis: the Nizam hybrid mono-repo, shipping six governance
  modules as a single portable payload — `standard/` (documentation standard,
  governance inheritance protocol, agent governance framework, universal
  anti-hallucination constraints), `methodology/` (planning enforcement,
  contract-first execution harness, adversarial TDD, circuit breaker,
  tool-driven state, release train), `registry/` (the `NIZAM.json` index
  schema and scope-definition patterns), `templates/` (consumer-repo
  CONTEXT/AGENTS/DEBT/ADR/work-packet/phase/manifest templates), `schema/`
  (JSON Schemas for every machine-readable framework artifact), and `tools/`
  (the single, unified, runtime-agnostic skill payload).
- `NIZAM.json`, the root machine-readable capability index and context
  router, validating against `registry/nizam-index.schema.json`.
- `bootstrap.sh`, the unified clone → inject → verify governance inheritance
  mechanism (the evolution of the earlier AGIP prototype) — clones a pinned
  `GOVERNANCE_TAG`, stages and injects `standard/`, `templates/`, `schema/`,
  `tools/`, and `NIZAM.json` into a consumer repository's `.nizam/`
  directory, verifies the injection, and records provenance. Supports a
  network-free `--verify-only` drift-detection mode and a `--help` mode.
