# Forward Roadmap

## Purpose and Authority

This document is the durable forward-planning surface for the framework. It is
**pre-planning intent, not a plan of record**: under `methodology/00_planning.md`, a
phase becomes real only when a Planner produces a product spec and a DAG-validated
feature list and a human authorizes activation. Until then, everything below is
candidate scope. `docs/planning/manifest.json` points here via its `forward_planning`
key; this file MUST be updated at each phase close so the repository always states
what comes next (the gap this file closes: phases 001–004 completed with no recorded
successor, leaving open debt deferred to unscoped "future phases").

## Current Position (2026-07-15)

- Phases 001–004 are complete. Phase 004 (Durable Enforcement & Dogfooding) merged to
  `main`; the validator runs green at `SUMMARY: 11 passed, 0 failed` (C1–C11) and the
  hermetic e2e bootstrap harness passes in CI.
- Latest released tag: v0.6.0 — the annotated tag was cut and pushed 2026-07-15 at the
  release commit 955c1d7 (CHANGELOG section dated 2026-07-13), executing Track 1's
  first human gate. The CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section holds post-release
  planning and release-automation updates.
- Open debt: NDEBT-004, NDEBT-005, NDEBT-007, NDEBT-008, NDEBT-009, NDEBT-010,
  NDEBT-011, NDEBT-012 (see `docs/planning/DEBT.md`).

## Track 1 — Outstanding Human Gates (no planning required)

These are recorded decisions awaiting execution by a human with release authority;
they need no new phase.

1. **Cut v0.6.0 — EXECUTED 2026-07-15.** The annotated tag `v0.6.0` was pushed at
   commit 955c1d7 per `methodology/06_release_train.md` (MINOR: additive, no breaking
   runtime change, `bootstrap.sh` unmodified). Residual: **publish the v0.6.0 GitHub
   Release page** — `README.md`'s release link points at it and 404s until it exists
   (every prior tag v0.1.0–v0.5.3 has a published Release page).
2. **Publish the user guide to GitHub Pages.** Outstanding since phase 003
   (`docs/guide/index.html` ships in-repo but is not yet published). Recorded in the
   phase-003 manifest note; still unexecuted.

## Track 2 — Phase 005 Candidate Scope: Consumer Reality & Enforcement Closure

The highest-leverage next phase closes the gap between what the framework enforces on
itself and what a real consumer experiences. Candidate features, sourced from the open
debt register (IDs refer to `docs/planning/DEBT.md`):

1. **Gate `tools/skill.json` content** (NDEBT-007): JSON-parse it, resolve every
   capability `module` path and the `entry_point` in default and `--payload` modes,
   with a negative fixture. This closes the enforcement hole that let a broken module
   pointer ship from v0.4.0 to v0.5.3.
2. **Resolve the injected-payload/methodology contradiction** (NDEBT-008, with
   NDEBT-004): decide whether `methodology/` joins the injected payload or
   pinned-checkout resolution becomes the stated contract for consumer installs, then
   align `bootstrap.sh`, `standard/GIP.md`, `tools/interface.md`, the payload-mode
   validator rules, and the e2e assertions with that single decision.
3. **Wire the negative fixtures into CI** (NDEBT-009): a fixtures job asserting each
   fixture fails its targeted check, so the validator's own checks cannot silently go
   vacuous.
4. **Define the Orchestrator role in the AGF** (NDEBT-010): the role is load-bearing
   across capability profiles, permission classes, MCP policy, the release train, and
   the framework's entire run history, yet undefined in the authoritative role
   registry.
5. **Recurrence guards for enumeration drift** (NDEBT-005): mechanize
   enumeration-completeness and bare-cross-reference checks, ideally sourced from a
   canonical index rather than hand-maintained lists.
6. **Align the work-packet template with its schema** (NDEBT-011).
7. **Fix the payload validator's CWD sensitivity** (NDEBT-012): anchor
   `tools/validate.sh --payload` path resolution to the script/payload root so
   `bash .nizam/tools/validate.sh --payload` from a consumer repository root behaves
   identically to invocation from inside `.nizam/`. Sourced from the first real
   external-consumer bug report (issue #18) — the exact consumer-reality evidence
   this phase exists to generate.

## Track 3 — Strategic Decision: Mechanize or Descope the Constitutional Layer

The v0.4.0 NMF hybrid shipped a constitutional policy surface (capability profiles,
the MERGE_READY CI-gate formula, eval-and-trace, eval-gated promotion, MCP policy,
failure modes, provenance, permission classes, cross-repo governance) that is
documentation-only: none of it is enforced by this repository's CI, none of it is
exercised by a consumer, and it entered the repository outside the framework's own
planning pipeline (recorded honestly in
`docs/architecture/ADR-003-vibe-coding-manifesto-hybrid.md`).

The next planning cycle MUST resolve, per constitutional document, one of:

- **Mechanize** — give it an enforcement or verification surface in this repository
  (the way NDS Section 7 got `tools/validate.sh`), or a conformance checklist a
  consumer can actually run; or
- **Descope explicitly** — mark it consumer-aspirational in its own frontmatter/body
  so the framework's first-contact surfaces stop implying enforcement that does not
  exist.

Either resolution also requires refreshing `docs/guide/index.html`, which still
narrates the phase-003 world and does not mention the constitutional layer at all.

## Track 4 — First External Consumer Pilot

All bootstrap evidence to date is self-referential: the e2e harness bootstraps the
framework into a scratch copy of itself. Before the constitutional layer grows
further, bootstrap a real second repository against a released tag, run
`tools/validate.sh --payload` in it, and feed every friction point back as debt.
This directly tests the NDEBT-004 and NDEBT-008 concerns in the environment they
actually describe, and produces the first non-self-referential adoption evidence.

## Sequencing Recommendation

Track 1 is immediate (minutes of human effort). Track 2 is the recommended phase 005,
activated through the standard planning lifecycle. Track 3's decision should be taken
during phase 005 planning — its outcome determines whether a phase 006 is an
enforcement phase or a documentation-truth phase. Track 4 can run in parallel with
phase 005 and should complete before any phase that expands cross-repo or
constitutional scope.
